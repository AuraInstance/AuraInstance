## 😂 Just for fun: A little dev joke

```python
# Programmer's relationship status simulator
class RelationshipStatus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status = "404: Girlfriend not found"

    def update_status(self):
        try:
            raise NotImplementedError("Love module not available.")
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

dev_life = RelationshipStatus()
dev_life.update_status()
