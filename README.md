Hi, 
i am @AuraInstance and nice to meet you. How you can see my profile is pretty empty, hmm. The thing is, i want to learn coding python acutally, so it was a good decision to make a GitHub for my future plans/projects.

So my future plan is being a programmer. I am now 30 years old and had a rough life that made my decisions for life very complicated what i really want. So my hobbies building computers and watching people making softwares was a huge impact into changing myself.
Just for info my main language is german, i know that my grammar isnt very well, but still thanks for reading. 

My complete hobby list is: Football, learning programming python & language japanese, watching animes, cooking and trying to motivate me for gym. So, thats all about me in short.

How you can reach me ?

Lets see what the future brings.
